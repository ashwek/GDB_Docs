# 3 GDB Commands

[Go Back](./README.md)

----

You can abbreviate a GDB command to the first few letters of the command name, if that abbreviation is unambiguous; and you can repeat certain GDB commands by typing just **RET**. You can also use the _TAB_ key to get GDB to fill out the rest of a word in a command.
