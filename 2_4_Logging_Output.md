# 2.4 Logging Output

[Go Back](./README.md)

----

You may want to save the output of GDB commands to a file. There are several commands to control GDBâ€™s logging.

```
set logging on
```
Enable logging.

```
set logging off
```
Disable logging.

``
set logging file file
``
Change the name of the current logfile. The default logfile is _**gdb.txt**_.

```
set logging overwrite [on|off]
```
By default, _GDB will append to the logfile_. Set overwrite if you want set logging on to overwrite the logfile instead.

```
set logging redirect [on|off]
```
By default, GDB output will go to both the terminal and the logfile. Set redirect if you want output to go only to the log file.

```
set logging debugredirect [on|off]
```
By default, GDB debug output will go to both the terminal and the logfile. Set debugredirect if you want debug output to go only to the log file.

```
show logging
```
Show the current values of the logging settings. You can also redirect the output of a GDB command to a shell command using pipe.
