# 4 Running Programs Under GDB

[Go Back](./README.md)

----

When you run a program under GDB, you must first generate debugging information when you compile it.

You may start GDB with its arguments, if any, in an environment of your choice. If you are doing native debugging, you may redirect your program’s input and output, debug an already running process, or kill a child process.
