# 9.2 Specifying a Location

----

Several GDB commands accept arguments that specify a location of your programâ€™s code. Since GDB is a source-level debugger, a location usually specifies some line in the source code. Locations may be specified using three different formats:
 - [Linespec Locations: Linespec locations](./9_2_1_Linespec_Locations.md)
 - [Explicit Locations: Explicit locations](./9_2_2_Explicit_Locations.md)
 - [Address Locations: Address locations](./9_2_3_Address_Locations.md)
